# Ricci Scalar Calculation Using Tensor Contractions

## Overview

The Ricci scalar \( R \) is a key quantity in General Relativity, representing the average curvature of spacetime. It is derived from the Ricci tensor \( R_{\mu \nu} \) by contracting it with the inverse metric tensor \( g^{\mu \nu} \).

## Mathematical Explanation

1. The Ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the Riemann curvature tensor:
   \[
   R_{\mu \nu} = R^\lambda_{\mu \lambda \nu}
   \]

2. **Ricci Scalar Calculation:**
   The Ricci scalar is computed by contracting the Ricci tensor with the inverse metric tensor:
   \[
   R = g^{\mu \nu} R_{\mu \nu}
   \]
